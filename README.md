# Keptn-in-a-Box (with Dynatrace Software Intelligence empowered) üéÅ

Keptn-In-A-Box is part of the automation for delivering Autonomous Cloud Workshops with Dynatrace. This is not a tutorial but more an explanation of what the shell file set up for you on a plain Ubuntu image. 

A simple Bash script will set-up a fully functional Single Node Kubernetes Cluster with Dynatrace installed and Kubernetes Cluster, Cloud Applications and Events monitoring enabled. This script is used as [userdata](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html) when spinning up elastic compute images (ec2) in amazon web services, but it can run also manually in a Linux machine or VM with snap installed. The tested distro is  *Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS & 20.04 LTS*
For spinning up instances automatically with AWS completely configured and set up, and also automating the creation and management of Dynatrace environments, take a look at this project- [Dynatrace - Rest Tenant Automation](https://github.com/sergiohinojosa/Dynatrace-REST-Tenant-Automation)

## ü•úKeptn-in-a-Box - Features in a Nutshell
- Update the ubuntu repository
- Installation of Docker (for building own Docker images)
- Installation of Microkubernetes (v1.15)
- Allow the Kube-API to run priviledged pods (necessary for deploying the FullStack Agent via Operator)
- Update IPTABLES: allowing traffic for pods internal and external
- Create a user (dynatrace in this case) with it's own Home directory and SSH access for doing the Hands-On workshop
- Set up of useful BASH Aliases for working with the command line
- Enable autocompletion of Kubectl
- Installation of Dynatrace ActiveGate and configuration of [Cluster](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/technology-support/cloud-platforms/kubernetes/monitoring/connect-kubernetes-clusters-to-dynatrace/) and [Workload monitoring](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/technology-support/cloud-platforms/kubernetes/monitoring/monitor-workloads-kubernetes/)
- Installation of Istio 1.5.1 
- Installation of Helm Client
- Enabling own Docker Registry for the Cluster
- Convert the public IP in a (magic) domain ([nip.io](https://nip.io/)) for being able to expose all the needed services with subdomains.
- Routing of traffic to Istio-Ingressgateway via a Kubernetes NGINX Ingress using standard HTTP(S) ports 80 and 443. This way we dont need a public IP from the Cloud Provider
- Installation of Keptn 
- Expose the Keptn-Bridge Service
- Installation of Dynatrace OneAgent via Keptn
- Deployment of the Unleash-Server
- Onboard of the Sockshop-Carts Sample project
- Deployment of a cartsloadgenerator PoD
- Deployment of a Autonomous Cloud teaser home page with links to the pipeline, bridge keptn-api. 
- Creation of valid SSL certificates with Certmanager and HTTPs Let's encrypt.
- Create a user account and copy the standard user (ubuntu on this case) with his own home directory (a replica) and allowing SSH connections with text password. Useful for spinning an army of workshop clusters. 

### üíªThe Keptn-in-a-Box Bash installation

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
    <p>
    The bash file is scripted in a modular fashion allowing you with  control flags to enable or disable the modules that you want to install in your box. This allows you to have a very slim cluster running keptn with the bare minimal resources or to have a full blown cluster with pretty much all the desired features and frameworks for your CI/CD pipelines and performance testings.

## üíæ Sizing

This section will give you an idea the nedded size for your Box. But it all dependson the modules you want to install and what is your goal and usecase.
The installer comes with 3 predefined modules: **minimal**, **default** and **full**.

Below is a table for the sizing reference if you run a local VM or are virtualizing locally.
### AWS sizings for reference 

| **Size**   | **vCPUs** | **Memory (GiB)** |
| ---------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| t2.medium  | 2         | 4                |
| t2.large   | 2         | 8                |
| t2.xlarge  | 4         | 16               |
| t2.2xlarge | 8         | 32               |

### installationModulesMinimal
The minimum required for running a Single Node Kubernetes cluster with keptn full features is a t2.medium (2 vCPU and 4 Gib of RAM) and 10 Gigabytes of disk space. If you feel frisky go for this size but the experience won't be the best. 

Adding more RAM and more CPUs will speed up things. Depending what you want to achieve. Also consider that you'll have available less than 2 Gigs of disk space. This is the available disk after a minimal installation.

```bash
df -h /
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/root       9.7G  6.9G  2.8G  72% /
```


### installationModulesDefault
The minimum required for running the default modules is t2.large with 13 Gigs of Disk space. We recommend 20 Gigs and t2.xlarge for the best experience.

### installationModulesFull
The minimum required for running the default modules is t2.large with 13 Gigs of Disk space.We recommend 20 Gigs and t2.2xlarge for the best experience.

## Get started in 1 - 2 - 3

### Run it in an available machine  (manually)

#### 1. Log in into  your Ubuntu image
#### 2. Clone the repo and navigate to the directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keptn-sandbox/keptn-in-a-box ; cd keptn-in-a-box
```
> Actually you only need to copy and execute the **keptn-in-a-box.sh** file. It'll take care of the rest and load the resources from github.

#### 3. Execute the file with sudo rights.
```bash
sudo ./keptn-in-a-box.sh &
```

And that was it! Yes that easy! Now if you notice is that there is an & in the command. This will send the installation job in the background. You will not see any output since stdout and stderr are piped to a logfile which is located by default in **/tmp/install.log** 

For inspecting the installation on realtime type:
```bash
less +F /tmp/install.log
```

#####  The installed modules

The default installation is **installationModulesDefault** which sets the control flag to true to the following modules:


```bash
  update_ubuntu=true
  docker_install=true
  microk8s_install=true
  setup_proaliases=true
  enable_k8dashboard=true
  istio_install=true
  helm_install=true
  keptn_install=true
  keptn_examples_clone=true
  resources_clone=true
  resources_route_istio_ingress=true
  dynatrace_savecredentials=true
  dynatrace_configure_monitoring=true
  dynatrace_activegate_install=true
  dynatrace_configure_workloads=true
  keptn_bridge_expose=true
  keptn_bridge_eap=true
  keptndemo_teaser_pipeline=true
  keptndemo_cartsload=true
  keptndemo_unleash=true
  keptndemo_cartsonboard=true
  microk8s_expose_kubernetes_api=true
  microk8s_expose_kubernetes_dashboard=true
```

Dynatrace OneAgent and Dynatrace ActiveGate will be installed and configured if you provided your credentials. Otherwise they won't be installed. 

The script will install all the modules shown above and the github repository will be cloned in the home (~) directory of the sudo user that executed the script.

>The script was first created  to be run as root without an interactive shell since it is passed as userdata on creation of the elastic cloud machine via a python rest automation program.

## üí™Empower your Keptn-in-a-box üéÅ with Dynatrace by adding it's credentials

- Add the Dynatrace information to the variables:

	- TENANT="https://mytenant.live.dynatrace.com"
	- PAASTOKEN=myDynatracePaaSToken
	- APITOKEN=myDynatraceApiToken

     > For Tenant add it with protocol like:
     >  *https://{your-domain}/e/{your-environment-id}* 
     > for managed or 
     > https://{your-environment-id}.live.dynatrace.com 
     > for SaaS



Generate an API token and a PaaS token in your Dynatrace environment.
Make sure you have the **Access problem and event feed, metrics, and topology** switch enabled for the API token.

For more details on the Integration with Dynatrace read the following links:
- [OneAgent Operator](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/technology-support/cloud-platforms/kubernetes/oneagent-with-helm/)
- [API Authentication](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/extend-dynatrace/dynatrace-api/basics/dynatrace-api-authentication/)
- [PaaS Token](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/reference/dynatrace-concepts/environment-id/#anchor_paas)
- [Kubernetes Cluster Monitoring with Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/technology-support/cloud-platforms/kubernetes/monitoring/connect-kubernetes-clusters-to-dynatrace/)
- [Kubernetes Events](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/technology-support/cloud-platforms/kubernetes/monitoring/events/)
- [Kubernetes Workloads](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/technology-support/cloud-platforms/kubernetes/monitoring/monitor-workloads-kubernetes/)


With the **installationModulesDefault** or **installationModulesFull** Dynatrace is automatically installed if the credentials are configured.


## Other installation options
### Spin your preconfigured Keptn-in-a-box machines with userdata  (manually in aws)
1. Log in to AWS
2. Click on "Launch instance"
3. Select "Ubuntu Server [18|20].04 LTS (HVM) "
4. Choose your Instance Type "t2.xlarge" or 2xlarge recommended.
5. Select "Next - configure instance details"
6. In Configure Instance details - Advanced options (below) copy the keptn-in-a-box.sh file. (as string or drop it, doesn't matter). Remember to edit your file if you want to customize your box.
7. Review it and launch your instance.

### Spin your preconfigured Keptn-in-a-box machines  with userdata (automated)
- Description to be added. Please see the [Dynatrace Rest Tenant Automation project](https://github.com/sergiohinojosa/Dynatrace-REST-Tenant-Automation) for reference. The RTA project can spin as many instances as you want by providing a simple CSV file. It will also create and configure Dynatrace environments for each CSV entry, üòç perfect for delivering workshops üë®‚Äçüíª. If you are interested in a workshop get in contact with us. 


## üõ† Customizing your installation

The keptn-in-a-box project is highly customizable (obviously since it's a bashfile) below are some customizations that are the most used. All customizations can and should be done in the ** keptn-in-a-box.sh** file and not in the **functions.sh** file. This way you keep a nice delegation of tasks and functionality. 

### Change the installation type to Minimal or Full
Comment out the Default and uncomment the installation type you want. For example for minimal:

```bash
#installationModulesDefault

installationModulesMinimal

#installationModulesFull
```
The same applies for Full.

### Change your own Domain
By default the Script will get the public ip and give it a magic domain with nip.io like ip=1.2.3.4 will become 1-2-3-4.nip.io. This way with an NGINX Ingress Keptn and all Istio and Kubernetes services are available with subdomains via the standard HTTP ports 443 and 80.

This is a sample could be if I'm running my box in a VirtualMachine in my home network:
```bash
DOMAIN=192.168.0.1.nip.io
```

### üîí Generate valid certificates with Lets Encrypt 

By adding/commenting out the following control flags, you'll install Certmanager. A Cluster Issuer will be added and a valid certificate with let's encrypt for your public endpoints will be created. This way the Keptn API and Kubernetes API will have a valid Certificate.

```bash
certmanager_install=true
certmanager_enable=true
```
Add the modules before the `doInstallation` 

### üë®‚Äçüíª Create a Workshop user 
You might have notice the following variables:
```bash
NEWPWD="dynatrace"
NEWUSER="dynatrace"
```
This variables in combination with the control flag `create_workshop_user=false` will create a workshop user. It will clone the `USER` home directory and add hi configuration so the `NEWUSER` can also interact with `keptn`, `docker` and `kubectl`. An SSH Password will be configured and allowed.

###  Change the Version of a component
This are the actual versions of the different Modules
```bash
# **** Installation Versions **** 
ISTIO_VERSION=1.5.1
HELM_VERSION=2.12.3
CERTMANAGER_VERSION=0.14.0
KEPTN_VERSION=0.6.1
KEPTN_DT_SERVICE_VERSION=0.6.2
KEPTN_DT_SLI_SERVICE_VERSION=0.3.1
KEPTN_EXAMPLES_BRANCH=0.6.1
TEASER_IMAGE="shinojosa/nginxacm"
KEPTN_BRIDGE_IMAGE="keptn/bridge2:20200326.0744"
MICROK8S_CHANNEL="1.15/stable"
```
Feel free to experiment and change the versions. We will try to keep the list up to date. 


###  Create your custom installation
At the beggining of the  `functions.sh` file the installation modules are listed. You can enable them in the `keptn-in-a-box.sh` file before calling the `doInstallation` function.

### Troubleshooting and inspecting the installation
To Inspect do 

```bash
less +F /tmp/install.log
```
and to have a verbose output (of every executed command) set the following control flag `verbose_mode=true` 


## DeepDive into the project (understanding how Microk8s, NGINX Ingress routing, Istio and Keptn work together)

This project was first presented to the Keptn Community in a Keptn Developer Meeting on the 23rd of April 2020.
